# Oregano

PoC Linux process injection (process hollowing) to hide execution
of Linux binary in an `htop` process.

## Usage

```
OPTIONS: oregano [PID/PATH] [EXECUTABLE/BIN]
```

The first argument defines the `tracee` either by PID or program to
execute, and the second argument defines whether you want your own shellcode,
or whether you want _my_ built-in shellcode to execute a file of your choosing.

## Contributing

Do so. Or don't. Up to you. You will get special thanks and stuff if you do.

### Note

It doesn't work _perfectly_. Sometimes, the _tracee_ segfaults or does
something weird. If you want to see what I'm talking about, try `sudo oregano 1 /usr/bin/reboot`

So, it's not exactly safe (nor do I think it will ever truly be) but it works _most_ of the time.
Nevertheless, I have eliminated segfaults and false positives regarding the shellcode's execution
to the best of my ability, though my ability is albeit limited.
